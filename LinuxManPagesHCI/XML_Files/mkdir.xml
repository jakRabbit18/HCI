<command>
<name>mkdir</name>
<synopsis>mkdir pathname ... [mode]</synopsis>
<description>mkdir() attempts to create a directory named pathname.

The argument mode specifies the mode for the new directory (see stat(2)).  It is modified by the process's umask in the usual way: in the absence of a default ACL, the mode of the created direct mode and ~umask and 0777).  Whether other mode bits are honored for thecreated directory depends on the operating system.  For Linux, seeNOTES below.
The newly created directory will be owned by the effective user ID of the process.  If the directory containing the file has the set-group-ID bit set, or if the filesystem is mounted with BSD group semantics(mount -o bsdgroups or, synonymously mount -o grpid), the new directory will inherit the group ownership from its parent; otherwise it will be owned by the effective group ID of the process.
If the parent directory has the set-group-ID bit set, then so will the newly created directory.
